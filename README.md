code for JASA2012 paper "Generalized Measures of Correlation for Asymmetry, Nonlinearity, and Beyond". In this paper, Aiming to develop broad applicable correlation measures, they study a pair of generalized measures of correlation (GMC) that deals with asymmetries in explained variances, and linear or nonlinear relations between random variables.
